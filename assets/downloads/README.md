## How to Replace Files:

Simply replace the dummy PDF files with your actual documents. Make sure to keep the same filenames:

- Keep the filename exactly the same (e.g., `admission-form.pdf`)
- The file must be in PDF format
- Place the file in this `assets/downloads` folder
- The download links on the website will automatically work

## Adding New Downloads:

If you want to add new downloadable files:

1. Add the PDF file to this folder
2. Update the download section in `index.html`
3. Add a new download card with the appropriate link

Example:
```html
<a href="/assets/downloads/your-file.pdf" download>
    Download
</a>
```

## Note:

The current PDF files are dummy files created for demonstration. Replace them with your actual school documents.
